# Microsoft Graph TypeScript Types Beta
The Microsoft Graph TypeScript definitions enable editors to provide intellisense on Microsoft Graph /beta endpoint objects including users, messages, and groups.

> **_NOTE:_**  APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change.

## Installation

We recommend including the .d.ts file by downloading this package through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```bash

# Install types and save in package.json as a development dependency
npm install @microsoft/microsoft-graph-types-beta --save-dev

```

## Examples
The following examples assume that you have a valid access token. The following example uses [isomorphic-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-fetch) and  [Microsoft Graph JavaScript client library](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript) -

```typescript
import { User } from "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types-beta";

import { Client } from "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client";

import 'isomorphic-fetch';

const client = Client.initWithMiddleware({
	defaultVersion: 'beta',
	...
});

const response = await client.api("/me").get();
const user = response as User;
```

### Example of creating an object
```typescript
// Create the message object

// Note that all the properties must follow the interface definitions.
// For example, this will not compile if you try to type "xml" instead of "html" for contentType.

let mail:MicrosoftGraphBeta.Message = {
    subject: "Microsoft Graph TypeScript Sample",
    toRecipients: [{
        emailAddress: {
            address: "microsoftgraph@example.com"
        }
    }],
    body: {
        content: "<h1>Microsoft Graph TypeScript Sample</h1>Try modifying the sample",
        contentType: "html"
    }
}
```

## Example of using v1 types and beta types together
```json
  "devDependencies": {
    // import published v1.0 types with a version from NPM
    "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types": "^0.4.0",
    // import beta types with a version from NPM
    "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types-beta": "^0.1.0-preview"
  }
}
```

```typescript
import * as MicrosoftGraph from "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types"

import * as MicrosoftGraphBeta from "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types-beta"

const v1User: MicrosoftGraph.User = {
	givenName: "V1 User"
}

const betaUser: MicrosoftGraphBeta.User = {
	givenName: "Beta User"
}

```

## Supported editors
Any TypeScript project can consume these types when using at least TypeScript 2.0.  We've tested including the types as a dependency in the following editors.
* Visual Studio Code
* WebStorm
* Atom with the [atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript) plugin
